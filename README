The parts that are resusable are the functions "dynamic_search / xhrHandler" in views/users/index.html.erb and the function "search" in controllers/users_controller.

The dynamic_search function takes in the search query and a 'result div' where the results of the search are to be displayed. For the actual display process, the function calls another function (display_results) - this is meant to be changed to fit the different need cases of each implimentation. That is, it can be changed to display different results.

The search function access the search query from the params[:q]. For the specific searching that needs to happen, it calls the "photo_search" function in the Photos model, which returns the needed results in an array. This function (photo_search) is intended to be changed depending on the use case.
